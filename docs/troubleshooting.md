# Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions.

## Installation Issues

### Docker Container Won't Start

**Symptoms:** Container exits immediately or fails health check

**Solutions:**

1. Check logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

2. Verify Docker resources (2GB RAM minimum)

 3. Check ports aren't in use:
```bash
lsof -i :5003
```

4. Rebuild without cache:
```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

### Port Already in Use

**Symptoms:** Error about port 5003 being in use

**Solutions:**

1. Find process using port:
```bash
lsof -i :5003
```

2. Stop the process or change port in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
ports:
  - "8080:5003"  # Use different host port
```

### Permission Denied Errors

**Symptoms:** Container can't write to volumes

**Solutions:**

1. Fix ownership:
```bash
sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) ./workspace ./data
```

## Authentication Issues

### Can't Log In

**Solutions:**

1. Clear browser cookies
2. Try incognito/private mode
3. Check `AUTH_SECRET` is set in production
4. Verify `AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` includes your URL

### Session Keeps Expiring

**Solutions:**

1. Ensure `AUTH_SECRET` is persistent across restarts
2. Check browser isn't blocking cookies
3. Verify `AUTH_SECURE_COOKIES=false` if using HTTP

### OAuth Redirect Error

**Solutions:**

1. Verify callback URL matches exactly in provider settings
2. Check for trailing slashes
3. Ensure protocol matches (http vs https)

### Passkey Not Working

**Solutions:**

1. Verify `PASSKEY_RP_ID` matches your domain
2. Check `PASSKEY_ORIGIN` includes correct protocol and port
3. Try a different browser
4. Ensure WebAuthn is supported

### Password Reset Not Working

**Solutions:**

1. Set all required variables:
```bash
ADMIN_EMAIL=your@email.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=new-password
ADMIN_PASSWORD_RESET=true
```

2. Restart container
3. Remove `ADMIN_PASSWORD_RESET=true` after reset

## Git Issues

### Clone Fails for Private Repository

**Solutions:**

1. Configure GitHub PAT in Settings > Credentials
2. Ensure PAT has `repo` scope
3. Check PAT hasn't expired

### Push/Pull Fails

**Solutions:**

1. Verify GitHub PAT is valid
2. Check PAT has write permissions
3. Verify remote URL: `git remote -v`

### Worktree Creation Fails

**Solutions:**

1. Ensure branch doesn't already exist
2. Check disk space
3. Verify repo isn't in detached HEAD state

## Chat Issues

### Messages Not Sending

**Solutions:**

1. Check CoStrict server is running:
```bash
docker exec opencode-manager ps aux | grep opencode
```

2. Verify model is configured
3. Check API key is valid

### Streaming Stops Unexpectedly

**Solutions:**

1. Check network connection
2. Look for errors in browser console (F12)
3. Check container logs for errors

### File Mentions Not Working

**Solutions:**

1. Ensure repository is selected
2. Check file exists
3. Refresh the file browser

## File Browser Issues

### Files Not Loading

**Solutions:**

1. Refresh the page
2. Check repository is properly cloned
3. Verify workspace volume is mounted

### Upload Fails

**Solutions:**

1. Check file size
2. Verify write permissions
3. Check browser console for errors

## Performance Issues

### Slow Response Times

**Solutions:**

1. Check Docker resources:
```bash
docker stats
```

2. Clear old sessions
3. Use `/compact` to reduce session size

### High Memory Usage

**Solutions:**

1. Limit session count
2. Delete unused sessions
3. Restart container:
```bash
docker-compose restart
```

### Database Errors

**Solutions:**

1. Stop container
2. Backup database:
```bash
cp ./data/opencode.db ./data/opencode.db.bak
```
3. Restart container

## Mobile Issues

### Keyboard Doesn't Close

1. Tap outside input field
2. Update device OS
3. Try Safari on iOS
